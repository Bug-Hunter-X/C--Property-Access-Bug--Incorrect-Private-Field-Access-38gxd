# C# Property Access Bug: Incorrect Private Field Access

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in C# related to accessing private fields through their corresponding properties.

## Bug Description

The `bug.cs` file contains a class `ExampleClass` with a private field `_myField` and a public property `MyProperty` that provides access to this field. The `MyMethod` function attempts to modify `_myField` using `this.MyProperty`, which is incorrect if the setter of `MyProperty` has any logic beyond a simple assignment.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.cs` file provides a corrected version. It shows how to properly use the property to update the private field without bypassing the setter's logic.
